        "Yes, this measurement is by no means accurate, this is because the data that feeds this value is not live.",

        "Since live energy market data, by generation source, is not currently available in Japan, we have to make these predictions.",
        "As this project develops, we hope to improve our predictions, but more than this, we hope that Japanese energy utilties will make available the required data in real time so that this number is not a prediction, but fact."

        "The carbon intensity is calculated for a given period by figuring out the proportion of energy generation that came from each fuel type.",
        "This proportion is then multiplied by the Carbon Intensity for that fuel type, for example, the carbon intensity factor for coal is 937 C02/kWh with Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) having a factor of 394 C02/kWh.",
        "This isn't perfect, as each generating plant is likely to have a different carbon intensity factor, which changes over the course of the year.",
        "Even more troublesome, the data used by this tool - which is provided by Japanese utility companies - considers all Fossil Fuels under one heading 'Thermal Generation', so with the data, we cannot tell what kinds of fuel were being burned during that period.",
        "Currently, we use other reporting and sources to try and figure out the average contribution of each fuel source.",
        "We realise this is not perfect and wish that the Japanese utilties would be more transparent about the kinds of fuel they are burning at what times, and what supplementary technologies they are using, such as carbon capture."
